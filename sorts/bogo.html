                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Bogosort</a> is a highly ineffective sort. It's mostly a joke sort. The idea is that you take an array and shuffle then check
                if it's in order. If it is then you're done, if not shuffle it again.
                This is one of many sorts that have been created to be purposefully ineffecient while still being correct.<p>

            <p>There are a lot of "versions" of Bogosort. Wikipedia lists Permutation Sort, Stupid Sort, Slowsort, Shotgun Sort or Monkey Sort as other names for Bogosort. It also lists Gorosort, Bogobogosort, Bozosort, and Worstsort as related algorithms.</p>

            <div class="normal clear">
                <div class="left paddingRight10 one" id="bozo"></div>
                <p>Bozosort works like Bogosort, but it only swaps two random elements at time. This seems like it might work better as it won't switch the array from almost sorted to completely unsorted in one move. However, as it still is choosing to swap elements randomly it could still go on forever.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="normal clear">
                <div class="left paddingRight10 one" id="smart-bozo"></div>
                <p>
                    This is an optimization of Bozosort. Although, it maybe strange to optimize a sort that is expected to be terrible. It chooses
                    a random pair of elements and swaps them only if they are out of order. While this is potentially more
                    efficent. The random choices mean it's still less efficent than other sorts.

            <p>
                Stupid Sort was the original name of <a href="./gnome.html">Gnome Sort</a>. However, it has also become an alternative name for Bogosort.
            </p>

            <p><a href="./slow.html">Slowsort</a> is in fact another sorting algorithm. So while Bogo is sometimes called that it is in fact a misnomer.</p>

            <p>
                Gorosort comes from a <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/975485/dashboard#s=p3" target="_blank">Google Code Jam</a>.
                The idea being that Goro can hold down some numbers and hit the table to shuffle the rest of the numbers.
                He chooses what to hold down optimally. Also, he has 4 arms.

            <p>
                <a href="./bad.html">Worstsort</a> is an algorithm based on <a href="./bad.html">Badsort</a>. It is guarenteed to complete if the universe does not end first.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shotgun Sort is another name for Bogosort. Monkey Sort has implementations that match both Bogo, Permutation and Bozosort.

            <div class="normal clear">
                <div class="left paddingRight10 one" id="permutation"></div>
                <p>Permutation Sort is a version of Bogosort that removes repeats. Instead of shuffling between rounds it will try every permutation of the array. This means that it works in time O(n!) with a best case of O(n). It is faster if the later elements in the array are out of order in this implementation as it alters the permutation starting at the end.</p>

                <div class="left paddingRight10 one" id="bogobogo"></div>
                <p>
                    Bogobogosort is a sort build not to succeed before the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank">heat death of the universe</a>'. This is a recursive Bogosort. Basically it starts with the first element and then adds one element at a time. If the new element is higher than the element before it, it will move on. If not it will shuffle everything up to and including that new element then start over at the first element again.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Quantum Bogosort sorts the list in O(1). It works as follows. Randomize the list so that you can't know the order without observing it. This divides the universe into O(n!) universes. This is fine due to the fact that all these universes exist anyway(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" target="_blank">Many-worlds interpretation</a>). If the list is not sorted destroy the universe(this is an exercise for the reader). All remaining universes contain a list which is sorted. It should be noted this is not by default a stable sort.
